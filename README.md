BlastCast - 2017 AT&amp;T Hackathon project

# Project Submission Description
BlastCast is a system that allows localized broadcasting for things like conventions and events. Admins send messages to a Raspberry Pi and have it broadcast to users in the area. Such an app could be used to send out announcements or direct peopleâ€™s attention (and possibly target specific people). The advantage is that you know the people you broadcast to are in the area.

# My contribution
The server and client model written in Python, where the server script would be loaded onto the Raspberry Pi. The client was used for testing, along with simple UDP messages sent from other devices using Netcat.
